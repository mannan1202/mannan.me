## The Importance Of Now

Has it ever occurred why people say to live in now, don't talk about future as its not in control & past is past done forever never to revisit again. The pretext
of living in now has more to do with awareness.

Its not to say people who think about dreams or try to ponder on to past happy moments
or sad ones are mad.

Now is a state which is forever alone, being alone is what not many people like, its a
dreadful feeling. The blanket of the future & comfiness which past gives is always more
valuable than living in coldness of NOW.

Maybe its not always cold, a warm smile form your mother, feeling protected & listened by
your father, sharing things with siblings, being in your lovers arms just to live that
moment forever that's NOW as humans we love this state of NOW.

As for everything that has come, has to go. All this momentarily happy moments of NOW, will
be gone forever. The thing that needs to be understood is we need be comfortable in our spirituality
of being alone & truly understand the power of NOW.

Seeking constant attention, desire to be seen, desire to be heard, desire to be important has killed
the spiritual nature of our beings.

That understanding might come NOW, might come later but being constantly aware of it will
go long way getting right eventually.
